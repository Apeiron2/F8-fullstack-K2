const text = `The article discusses five key steps to prepare for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to mitigate potential damages. 

**Step 1: Map Vulnerable Assets**  
Understanding the scope of assets exposed to potential attacks is the first step in security. This includes identifying physical and virtual assets, such as data centers, servers, applications, IP addresses, and domains.

**Step 2: Assess Potential Damages**  
Evaluating the worth of these assets is essential, considering direct and indirect damages. Direct damages include loss of revenue, productivity, SLA obligations, damage to brand, and loss of customers.

**Step 3: Assign Responsibility**  
Assigning responsibility for DDoS protection is vital. Organizations need to define roles and responsibilities to ensure proper protection for each asset.

**Step 4: Set Up Detection Mechanisms**  
Early detection mechanisms are crucial to alert organizations when an attack occurs. These measures can be implemented at the network or application level to monitor and alert against potential threats.

**Step 5: Deploy a DDoS Protection Solution**  
Choosing the right protection solution based on the characteristics, risk, and value of each asset is the final step. This can include on-demand cloud mitigation services, always-on cloud services, hardware-based appliances, or hybrid DDoS protection.

The article highlights the importance of being prepared before a DDoS attack occurs, emphasizing the need for vigilance and proactive security measures to protect against potential threats.`;
